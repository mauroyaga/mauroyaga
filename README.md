I'm a first-year undergraduate student in system analysis and development, and I'm passionate about the entire programming universe. My plans are to develop myself enough so that I can use technology to improve my life and the lives of those around me.

I am from a generation that didn't have computer networks around me, and all possibilities were limited by imagination. Today, being able to explore technologies and use them to change the reality around me feels like my imagination has been set free.
